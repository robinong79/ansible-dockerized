# Ansible Playbook Docker Image


## Build

* Based on `Alpine Linux`
* Use the new `ARG` variable from Docker >= 1.10
* Fetch Ansible from official release website


```
$ docker build . --build-args ansible_version=2.2.1.0
```

## Run

Executes `ansible-playbook` command against an externally mounted set of Ansible playbooks.

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -v PATH_TO_LOCAL_PLAYBOOKS_DIR:/ansible/playbooks \
  philm/ansible_playbook \
  PLAYBOOK_FILE

```



### Basics

For example, assuming your project's structure follows best practices, the command to run ansible-playbook from the top-level directory would look like:

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks \
  philm/ansible_playbook \
  site.yml
```

> Note:
> --
> Ansible playbook variables can simply be added after the playbook name.



### SSH Keys

If Ansible is interacting with external machines, you'll need to mount an SSH key pair for the duration of the play:

```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
    -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks \
    philm/ansible_playbook site.yml
```


### Ansible Vault

If you've encrypted any data using Ansible Vault, you can decrypt during a play by either passing --ask-vault-pass after the playbook name, or pointing to a password file. For the latter, you can mount an external file:

```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks \
    -v ~/.vault_pass.txt:/root/.vault_pass.txt \
    philm/ansible_playbook site.yml --vault-password-file /root/.vault_pass.txt
```

Note: the Ansible Vault executable is embedded in this image. To use it, specify a different entrypoint:

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks \
  --entrypoint ansible-vault \
  philm/ansible_playbook encrypt FILENAME
```


### Testing Playbooks - Ansible Target Container

The Ansible Target Docker image is an SSH container optimized for testing Ansible playbooks.

First, define your inventory file.

```
[test]
ansible_target
```

Be sure your testing playbooks include the correct host and remote user:

```
- hosts: test
  remote_user: ubuntu

  tasks:
  ... tasks go here ...
```

When testing the playbook, you'll need to link the two containers:

```
docker run --rm -it \
    --link ansible_target \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
    -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks \
    philm/ansible_playbook tests.yml -i inventory
```

Note: the SSH key used above should match the one used to run Ansible Target.



### Docker Compose

An sample `docker-compose.yml` file is in this repo's test directory.

Example:

```
docker-compose run --rm test remote.yml -i inventory
```

And if you'd like the ansible_target container to be recreated each time, do:

```
docker rm -v -f ansible_target
```

(Eventually Compose will be able to automatically remove services after each run, see https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/2774)



### Privileged Operations

Notice the `privileged: true` option in the compose file.
This enables us to better mimic a VM environment and perform operations such as installing the Docker Engine during a playbook run see Docker Reference.
